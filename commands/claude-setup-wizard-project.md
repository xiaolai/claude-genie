# Claude Setup Wizard - Project Configuration

You're setting up Claude Code for a specific project. This wizard creates language-specific configurations, specialized agents, and project workflows.

---

## Step 1: Welcome and Prerequisites

```
You're the Project Setup Wizard. Your job is to configure this specific project perfectly.

First, make sure they've done global setup:
- Check if $HOME/.claude/CLAUDE.md exists
- If it doesn't, tell them: "Hold on! You need to run `/claude-setup-wizard-global` first to set up your identity."
- If it does exist, continue

Read their global config to get their names.
Greet them warmly using their CTO identity:

"Hi [their name]! I'm [CTO name], ready to configure Claude Code for this project.
This takes about 3 minutes - we'll set up language-specific optimizations, create your project agents, and configure workflows.
Ready to make this project awesome? (y/n)"

Wait for them to say yes before continuing.
```

---

## Step 2: Language Configuration

```
Time to set up language-specific optimizations.

First, check if this project already has configuration:
- Look for ./.claude/CLAUDE.md
- If it exists, ask: "I found existing project configuration. Should I keep it or create fresh settings? (keep/fresh)"
- If they want to keep it, skip to Step 3

Now find out what language they're using:
"What programming language is this project? (like Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, etc.)"

After they tell you:
- Search for current best practices for that language
- Look up common patterns and pitfalls
- Research testing strategies for that language

Create their project configuration at ./.claude/CLAUDE.md with:
- Language-specific best practices (5-7 tips)
- Common mistakes to avoid (3-5 pitfalls)
- Testing strategies that work well
- Performance optimization tips
- Recommended tools and libraries

After creating it, explain:
"Perfect! I've configured [language] best practices for this project.
This project config works together with your global settings - project settings take priority when there's overlap."

CONFIGURATION TO WRITE:
```markdown
# Project Configuration

## Language: [LANGUAGE]

## [LANGUAGE]-Specific Best Practices

[5-7 language-specific best practices based on research]

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

[3-5 common mistakes in this language]

## Testing Strategy

[Language-appropriate testing approach]

## Performance Optimizations

[2-3 performance tips for this language]

## Recommended Tools

[Language-specific tools and libraries]
```

INFORM after creation:
"Created project configuration at ./.claude/CLAUDE.md with [LANGUAGE]-specific optimizations.

Configuration hierarchy:
- ./.claude/CLAUDE.md (this file) - Highest priority
- $HOME/.claude/CLAUDE.md (your identity) - Base configuration"

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- ./.claude/CLAUDE.md created with language content
- User understands configuration hierarchy
```

## Step 3: Create Your Project Agents

```
Now let's create two specialized assistants for this project.

Ask them:
"I'll create two specialized agents for your [language] project:
1. A Code Auditor - reviews code quality and security
2. A Researcher - finds best practices and designs solutions

What would you like to name them? (I suggest 'auditor' and 'researcher', but you can pick any names)"

After they give you names, create the agents folder if needed (./.claude/agents/).

For the Code Auditor, create ./.claude/agents/[their-chosen-auditor-name].md:

```yaml
---
name: [auditor_name]
description: Code quality and security reviewer for [LANGUAGE] projects
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, WebSearch, WebFetch, TodoWrite, Bash, BashOutput, KillBash
model: opus
color: yellow

## Step 4: Setup Progress Tracking

```
Let's set up a way to track your progress on this project.

Tell them:
"I'm creating a changelog command for you. This helps track what you've completed, important decisions, and what's next.
You'll be able to use `/changelog` anytime to record progress."

Create the commands folder if needed (./.claude/commands/).

Then create ./.claude/commands/changelog.md:
```markdown
---
name: changelog
description: Update project changelog with session progress
execute: true
---

# Changelog Command

Updates ./log/changelog.md with:
- Current date and time
- Summary of changes made
- Decisions and rationale
- Next steps identified
- Any blockers or issues

Automatically adds entry formatted as:

## [DATE] - Session with [CTO_NAME]
### Changes
- List of modifications

### Decisions
- Architectural choices made

### Next Steps
- TODOs identified

### Notes
- Any important observations
```

3. CREATE directory ./log/ if it doesn't exist

4. CREATE initial ./log/changelog.md:
```markdown
# Project Changelog

## Project: [Current Directory Name]
